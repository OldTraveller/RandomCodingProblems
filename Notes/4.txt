Most of the data that we have at Rakuten is the unclassified data. 
So we have to employ the Unsupervised Learning model. 

So, we also do a reinforcement learning model wherein the trained data is automatically put back to the catalog. 
And the training models will be improved upon the thing already present. 


Some of the common Machine Learning models are -
K Nearest Neigbours, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, KNN, CNN etc. 

Prerequisites to learn ML -> 
Linear Algebra 
Statistics and Probability
Calculus
Graph Theory
Programming Skills - Python mostly. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While training the model, the data is usually split in the ration 80-20.
So we feed in 80% of the data. And build the model. 
Now the model will create some logic of it's own there. 
And then from there the next 20% of the data will be put on it to test the accuracy of the model thus trained.

In Rakuten, whatever data that we have we have to carry out multiclass classification there. 
Binary Classification and Multiclass Classification is present. 
Eg Binary Classification :- Whether a customer has purchased a product or not. YES or NO. 
Multiclass Classification :- To group the data into more than one class. Eg - Shoes -> Color : Black, Brown, Red etc, Men Shoes, Size - 7UK
